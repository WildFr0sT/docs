### 1. Linux and Mac:  

#### 1.1 Install nvm
1.1.1.	It is recommended to use nvm for installing node.

 Connect with Github
    * bb connect service_name [-f] // [-f force if needed to change existing connection] 
    * Command to connect with git service provider


## Creating a block using the CLI

#### Creating a new block  

A block should be created under a packaged block (parent block) steps  
Create a new packaged block will prompt with pic1
   
    > bb init packaged_block_name    
   
This will create a packaged_block_name dir with block.config.json and if the chosen sample project that will be also there.    
   
Now cd into packaged_block_name workspace  
   
To create block can create ui-container , ui-elements , function , shared-fn , job blocks will prompt with pic2 for job block and for rest there will be no prompt for enter cron schedule and time zone information, the rest workflow is same for all blocks  
   
     > bb create block_name  
    
To pull block (also have option to pull and create with new name) will prompt with pic3, where user can create a new clone or fork the block OR just use it as it is   
   
     > bb pull block_name   
     
 
#### Creating an app and adding blocks to it    
To create an app   
  
    > bb create-app   
   
 will prompt with pic4
 will create app for the packaged_block so that user can deploy it

 #### Pushing and Publishing after Creation
 
 After your necessary changes are made in the code,  
  
     > bb push [-f or block_name]  
     
  [-f => push all changes to this block or specified block]  
     
 To publish the block,  
  
     > bb publish block_name  
     
## Using the purchased block

From either Manage Blocks or Purchase History in Spaces, do the following steps.
* Assign the block to an app within this space (Can assign the app from the cli too ).
* Install code with bb pull (downloading the code with our CLI). This can be done from either of the following pages:
  * Purchase History
  * Manage Blocks

## Deploying the app
Upload a blocks before publish each block with the following command  

     > bb upload -env dev    
     
The following command for deploying the app will prompt to choose uploaded blocks, and then the deploying method  

     > bb deploy
