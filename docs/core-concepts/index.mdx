## SDM

“Data is the core”; having defined data models can be used by multiple apps making those apps interconnected in the data layer. SDM is one such data model in the making.

Appblocks gives a platform where people can view, discuss and collaborate to build that SDM, a universal schema store.

## **Block**

The ability to stitch multiple independently developed blocks of code together seamlessly is called Composability. And we call these “Blocks”.

Each block is stored in a separate GitHub repository ( multi-repo).
