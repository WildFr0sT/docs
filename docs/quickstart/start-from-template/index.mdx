To create composable apps/ blocks, we definitely need some set of tools.

BB(Build with Blocks) CLI is used to create, collaborate, manage, and deploy blocks by connecting with Appblocks Registry(Blocks Store).

**Install BB CLI**

npm i @appblocks/bb-cli -g

This will install our CLI globally.

Hit bb To list see all the commands in CLI

**Create your first Block**

To create a block make sure to log in to appblocks and connect with your GitHub account.

Use the below commands to do that

bb login

Above command will open your default browser and ask you to authenticate CLI with your Appblocks Account. ( if you are not signed up yet signup option before login).

bb connect github

This will open up the browser to authorize your CLI with your GitHub account. ( make sure to provide access to required organizations)

bb connect GitHub --force to forcefully authorize again.
