# Publishing a Block

The blocks you create with the BB-CLI will appear in the store and other pages of your logged in Appblocks account right after the sync step. 
Ensure that you have [created a version and published the block from the CLI](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/CLI/commands). 

* Visit the [Manage Blocks](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/Platform%20Features/Sales%20and%20Purchases/Manage%20Blocks) page.
* Choose own blocks tab from the table and find your block.
* There will be a call to action to publish the block.

* On clicking the Publish, you will be redirected to fill a form.  
<!--    ii. Through **Sales History** ([Read more](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/Tracking%20your%20Sales%20and%20Orders#sales-history))  
    * You will find three tabs on the table with different information - Blocks Sales Summary, Order Details, Payout History.
    * Sales information will list details of your blocks that are already on sale, and you will have the option of delisting that block.  
    * On this page, you will see an option to sell a block.  
    * Takes you to a form where you will choose the block you want to list.  
    * Private blocks will be your list of blocks that were delisted/never on sale.  
    * In this table, you will see an option to sell the block against each.  
    * Clicking on the action will take you to a form to fill out the details.   -->

* Submit the form and wait for Appblocks admins to review your block. The review status will be shown on the next tab. If approved, your block will get published to the Block Store.
<!-- If rejected, the admins will give the reason why. Make necessary changes and try again.-->
