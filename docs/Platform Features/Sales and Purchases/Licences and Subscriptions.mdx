In the case of the MIT License, 

1. Users are allowed to:

* Use the code in commercial applications: For example, a company can create a proprietary piece of software that includes all or part of the original open source code, then charge money for that software.
* Modify the code: In other words, developers can change/update the code however theyâ€™d like.
* Distribute copies of the code and any modifications: As long as the original copyright notice and the license itself are included, an organization can distribute and sell copies or modified versions of the code.
* Sublicense the code: This means you can incorporate the original code into a modification with a stricter license.
 
2. Users are not allowed to:
* Hold the code author(s) legally liable for any reason.
* Delete the copyright notice and original license from your version of the code.
